To locally test which PRs Renovate will create, you'll still need to put your renovate.json into a repo.

I used a fork of our main repo. I then disabled all the github actions.

Install renovate.

Note that it doesn't appear to correctly set up scripts on MacOS, so I had to add two scripts myself:

```
% cat ~/moj/scripts/renovate
node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/renovate/dist/renovate.js $*

% cat ~/moj/scripts/renovate-config-validator
node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/renovate/dist/config-validator.js $*
```

Once this is done, you can validate the config (this can be done without a repo):

```
% renovate-config-validator
 INFO: Validating renovate.json
 INFO: Config validated successfully
```

This is useful if you make changes, before you push them to your repo and realise you broke something.

You will also need to onboard the repo with Renovate, by [adding Renovate as an app to the repo](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate).

Once done, you can view your onboarded repos at https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard

To do a dry run and see which PRs Renovate would open, you first need a github token. I generated a classic one as the fine-grained one didn't seem to work.

Then:

```
renovate --dry-run --include-forks=true --token=<github token> townxelliot/opg-lpa
```

(replacing <github token> with yours, and townxelliot/opg-lpa with your clone repo)
